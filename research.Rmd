## PhD Thesis

[Essays on the economics of climate change: mitigation and adaptation in the agricultural sector](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03544096/)

**Supervisor:** Stéphane De Cara

This thesis addresses economic issues related to climate change, from both a mitigation and an adaptation perspective and with a focus on the implications for agriculture. The three chapters collect different papers in environmental economics, agricultural economics, industrial organization and a systematic literature review.
