I am a PhD candidate in economics at UMR Economie Publique (Université Paris-Saclay, INRAE, Agroparistech). I am also an assistant lecturer (ATER) at the Social Sciences department of ENS Paris-Saclay.
I work on economic issues related to climate change, from both a mitigation and
an adaptation perspective and with a focus on the implications for agriculture.
