      "description": "I'm an assistant professor at [LEDa, Université Paris-Dauphine](https://leda.dauphine.fr/) in Paris, France. I work on economics relevant to climate change. In particular, I am interested in modeling and estimating climate change impacts, planning and assessing adaptation options, designing mitigation policies, and their specific implications for agriculture. I co-organize the [Dauphine economics seminar](https://leda.dauphine.fr/fr/seminaire-externe/seminaire-leda.html). ",
